secret+salt junk needs to be programmed.

combine the good parts from LIF and old random number generator.

Maybe the blockmaker should be rewarded for each signer he includes. This would disincentivize him from trying to cheat by including less signers.
so say minsigners = 10, maxsigners = 15

say there are 10 signers
reward is 0

11 signers
reward is 20%

12 signers
reward is 40%



write the transaction types for slasher.

Explain all the attack scenarios that you imagined while writing the code, post it on #bitcoin-wizards

minimum amount of money per address (maybe a new tx type for deleting addresses would be useful?)

*replace 'count' with the rule that every tx must reference a hash from a recent block, and every tx must be non-identical to every other tx in recent blocks.
***Maybe we should not do this, because micro transactions wont work.
*********could be even better to make a transaction type for off-chain transactions.
