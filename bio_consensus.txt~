consensus=homeostasis
nodes=cells
When it becomes possible to create fake forks that look real=cancer
methods to tell which forks are fake=immune system hunts and destroys cells that are starting to go cancerous.


The argument against POS is this: It doesn't cost anything to create blockchains of any sort


Incentives for homeostasis.
Each cell really likes the existence of the human, because when the cells work together this way, the emergent behaviour makes survival easier. Each individual cell wants to over-exploit this resource. They want to consume all the food instantly, and reproduce as fast as possible. This exploitation would end up destroying homeostasis. To stay alive, the human needs a strict set of rules for cellular reproduction. The rules need to be strict enough to catch every type of cell that starts becoming cancerous, and to kill the cell before it goes completely cancerous. 
There is an additional type of reproduction, called sexual reproduction. It reproduces the entire organism without threatening homeostasis. The rules do not prevent this type of reproduction.



Incentives for consensus.
Each node really likes the existence of consensus. The emergent behaviour makes survival easier for nodes. Each node wants to over-exploit this resource. They want to double-spend money, and spend other people's money. This exploitation would end up destroying consensus. To maintain consensus, the blockchain needs a strict set of rules for how to make blocks. The rules need to be able to tell the difference between the fake and real fork. When it is n

There is an additional type of block that can be mined. It reproduces the entire blockchain from a point in history without threatening consensus. The rules do not need to prevent this type of reproduction.
